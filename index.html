        <p>This page contains all the links to colab notebooks used in the Lovelace Bootcamp. During the 3-weeks Python for Data Science bootcamp you will learn about the basic tools you need in order to start your journey in machine learning. As this course is open for beginners in programming, we will start the bootcamp by touching upon the basics of Python. In the first week, you will learn about variables, operations, datatypes, among others. During the second week, we will dive into data science. After finishing the second week, you will have some experience working with python libraries that can be used for data science like NumPy, Matplotlib and Pandas. In the last week you will already have some experience with manipulating datasets from Kaggle website & other platforms.</p>
